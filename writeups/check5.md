This checkpoint took me about [n] hours to do. I did not attend the lab session.

Program Structure and Design of the Router:
I kepts the router table as a vector containing all routing info. Every time route() is called, we loop through the router table to find the longest match.

Implementation Challenges:
N/A

Remaining Bugs:
Currently need to loop through the whole table to find the longest match. Could potentially improve this by using a mapping.
